## Side project - Portfolio - What can I do?
Working on personal projects not only helps me maintain a continuous learning habit and sharpen my programming skills, but also deepens my understanding of product development thinking. In the ever-evolving world of technology, programming languages change rapidlyâ€”what's relevant today may be outdated tomorrow. Therefore, staying updated, practicing regularly, and strengthening core fundamentals are crucial to me. This approach ensures that I not only keep pace with industry advancements but also contribute creatively to the field.
